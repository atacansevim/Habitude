# What exactly is a Habitude?
Habitude is an iOS app that helps motivated people adopt new habits in their daily lives. Habitude delivers it by allowing users to pick new habits, write an action plan, set up reminders, track their progress and stick to them for the long term.

# How are we different?
● We heavily lean into the dopamine-hitting experience. <br>
● Most apps have habit lists, tracking systems, and reminders. Some educate about habits, give scientific background, and even 1-1 coaching. However, no app on the market gives our natural dopamine-hitting experience when marking the habit done
